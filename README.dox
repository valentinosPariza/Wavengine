 This program as usual is a great example of implementation of some great ,but
 important techniques in programming language C. As requested by the assignment
 4, from the department of computer science of university of cyprus , and more
 specific from course CS232 ,we have implemented a library with many modules
 which each module represent a functionable module-function-method that can be
 used to manipulate soundtracks of type WAVE (.wav files). All these modules
 are stored inside a compressed file from where we use its methods in a method
 client giving some functionality for processing soundtracks of type WAVE.
 That library contains methods like (mixing two sound tracks ,encoding a message
 in a soundtrack and decoding a message from a soundtrack,printing information
 about the header of a soundtrack (WAVE -> .wav file), converting a sound track
 from steeo to mono and many more. For more information about the methods of
 the library see header file @see wavelib.h .

 As a coclusion we would like to thank all of our tutors and professors for 
 their excellent contribution of knowledge and help to this assignment.

 We are glad that we have tried and dealt with such great assignments because
 ,assignments like these are problems that can be seen today. It was a great
 experience!
