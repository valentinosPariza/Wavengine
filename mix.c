/**
* @brief Mixes two soundtracks indicated by two pointers of WAV structs ,creating a new WAV struct
*
* This method takes two pointers to structs of type WAV,that contain inforamtion in 
* a header section and data in a data section about the soundtrack. . By saying 
* "mix the two soundtracks " ,it means to take the two soundtracks and put the
* first one to the right channel and the second one to the left channel. More
* specific it takes the left channel of the second soundtrack,if it is stereo, 
* and places it to the left channel of the new soundtrack(if it is mono it takes
* its single channel) and if the first one is stereo,it takes the right channel
* of it and places it to the right channel of the new soundtrack (if it is mono
* it takes the single channel of it and places it to the right channel of the 
* new soundtrack ). The new soundtrack created is placed in a place in memory
* which address is passed as an argument.

* 
* @param a pointer to a struct of type WAV which indicates the first sound track
*         to be mixed
* @param a pointer to a struct of type WAV which indicates the second sound track
*         to be mixed
*
* @param a pointer to a variable which points to a struct of type WAV which 
*         indicates the final mixed soundtract (struct of type WAV)
*
* @return EXIT_SUCCESSif the mix was executed succesfully or EXIT_FAILURE if
*         there was a problem during the execution of the method
