 * creating the reversed sound track , the struct created (of type WAV) is 
 * placed in a place in memory (variable) which address of that place is given
 * as a parameter.
 *
 * @param a pointer to a struct of type WAV which is the sound track to reverse
 *
 * @return EXIT_SUCCESSif the reverse-method was executed successfully or
